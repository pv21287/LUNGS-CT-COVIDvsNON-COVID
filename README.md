Abstractâ€”this research project focuses on the binary classification problem utilizing the COVID-CT dataset. In Wuhan, China recently arose a novel pneumonia-like coronavirus, COVID-19. Subsequently, COVID-19 infected and infected numerous individuals across the world. One strategy for stopping the spread of this virus is the isolation of affected persons. CT scans give comprehensive pulmonary imaging and support the diagnosis of COVID-19 by radiologists in hospitals. The CT scan of one individual however involves hundreds of slides, and a COVID-19 diagnosis utilizing such images can lead to hospital delays. Radiologists with quick and precisely detected COVID-19 infection from these scans may be assisted by artificial intelligence approaches. This study suggests the classification of COVID-19 and normal CT volumes by artificial intelligence (AI). In each CT picture of a 3D CT scan the proposed AI approach employs a deep learning model ResNet-50 to forecast COVID-19. This AI approach then combines predictions of the picture level to diagnose COVID-19 on the volume of 3D CT.
